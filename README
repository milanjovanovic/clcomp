CLCOMP

CLCOMP is wannabe self-hosting Lisp compiler.
Objective is to bootstrap compiler with one of existing Common Lisp implementations.
Since at the end I want to compile compiler with itself I'm trying not to use too much of Common Lisp for compiler code.
For now there is assembler implementation, compiler is almost finished, GC is non existant and Runtime is mostly missing
End goal is working REPL and compile-based EVAL.
