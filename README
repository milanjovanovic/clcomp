CLCOMP

CLCOMP is wannabe self-hosting Lisp (subset of Common Lisp) compiler targeting x86-64.
This is toy project used for learning more about compilers and having fun in implementing it.
Objective is to bootstrap compiler with one of existing Common Lisp implementations.
Since at the end I want to compile compiler with itself I'm trying not to use too much of Common Lisp for compiler code.
For now there is assembler implementation, compiler is almost finished, GC is non existent and Runtime at least can execute compiled "image".
Currently I'm only testing it on OSX (should work on Linux though)
