CLOMP
------------------------------------

This is humbly attempt to write toy lisp compiler (not Common Lisp compiler).
Objective is to bootstrap compiler and nothing else.
Using Common Lisp (SBCL precisely) for bootstraping.
Since our objective is only to bootstrap compiler we don't want to use heavy CL stuff in writing it (that is the reason code is archaic).
Simple design consist of small C runtime/gc and compiler/assembler written in lisp.

Why are you doing this ?
Because our regular java jobs are boring and this is fun, and because I dont have extensive knowledge in writing compilers.
